## Exercises

### Exercise 1

Below are histograms plotting the distribution of plastic waste per
capita faceted by continent. The majority of all continentsâ€™
distributions of plastic waste per capita fall between 0 and .5 kg/day.
For those continents which have countries with a plastic waste per
capita above .5 kg/day, it seems that North America has the most
followed by South America and Asia tied for second place.

``` r
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2) + facet_wrap(~continent)
```

    ## Warning: Removed 51 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range
    ## (`stat_bin()`).

### Exercise 2

``` r
ggplot(
  data = plastic_waste,
  mapping = aes(
    x = plastic_waste_per_cap,
    color = continent,
    fill = continent
  )
) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.2)
```

    ## (`stat_density()`).
